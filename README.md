# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - Item Tracker

**Work in progress - I plan to add tracking for keys, fairies, and other items eventually.**

This project is a Java-based GUI application that makes use of the Model View Controller design pattern to track in-game items collected throughout a Majora's Mask randomizer playthrough.

For a more detailed description of the project, please see [my presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAQl9lpXcnQ&list=LLJMwrQ6-W7UdTNswm3hzgOQ).

## Installation Instructions

There are two ways to run the application, both requiring use of the [JRE (Java Runtime Environment)](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

### Executable JAR (preferred route)
1. Download the following files from the "runnable" directory within the ZeldaTracker GitHub repository.
    - ZeldaTracker.jar
    - collectables.txt
2. Run ZeldaTracker.jar (**IMPORTANT NOTE: Ensure that both files are placed in the same folder on your system**).

### IDE (Eclipse)
1. Download Eclipse IDE.
2. Create a new project (name it whatever you wish).
3. Download the "src" directory and "collectables.txt" from the ZeldaTracker GitHub repository and add both to your project folder.
4. Open Driver.java in Eclipse and run the program.
