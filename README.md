# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask - Item Tracker

This project is a Java-based GUI application that makes use of the Model View Controller design pattern to track in-game items collected throughout a Majora's Mask randomizer playthrough.

For a more detailed description of the project, please see [my presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAQl9lpXcnQ&list=LLJMwrQ6-W7UdTNswm3hzgOQ).

## Installation Instructions

There are two ways to run the application, both requiring use of the [JRE (Java Runtime Environment)](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).

### Executable JAR (preferable route)
- Download the following files from the "runnable" directory within the ZeldaTracker GitHub repository.
    1. ZeldaTracker.jar
    2. collectables.txt
- IMPORTANT NOTE: Ensure that both files are placed in the same folder on your system.
- Run ZeldaTracker.jar (as long as the .txt file is in the same folder, the application should run without issue)

### IDE (Eclipse)
1. Download Eclipse IDE
2. Create a new project (name it whatever you wish)
3. Download the "src" directory from the ZeldaTracker GitHub repository and add it to your project folder
4. Open Driver.java in Eclipse and run the program
